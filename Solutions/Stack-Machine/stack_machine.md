# Stack Machine levels
## Introduction
The idea of a stack is to have a list of values we can manage using a model called FIFO (First in - First out) by storing them on adjacent memory locations. When we want to insert a value in the storage, we **push** it. When we want to extract a value from the stack, we **pop** it. Every time we **push** values, we stack them on adjacent memory locations and when we want to **pop** a value, the top element of the stack is removed.

In this category you learn to implement the stack-operation macros that will help with simplifying the code by using the so called **Stack Memory** to get access to values that we stored for later use. We will implement stack operations, jump operations, functions and conditionals between two values. Having these will reduce the amount of code we would normally have using just Assembly. 

## Solutions description
Solving the levels problems is all about implementing stack operation macros using Assembly code and then using these macros for future levels. This way we will have a list of macros we can use anytime they are needed.

## Solutions catalogue
Stack Machine levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Stack Operations](Stack-operations/stack_operations.md)
2. [Jumps](Jumps/jumps.md)
3. [Function Calls](Function-calls/function_calls.md)
4. [Conditionals](Conditionals/conditionals.md)
