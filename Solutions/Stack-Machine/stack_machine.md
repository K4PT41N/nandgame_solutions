# Stack Machine Levels
## Introduction
The idea of a stack is to have a list of values we can manage using a principle called LIFO (Last In - First Out) by storing them in adjacent memory locations. When we want to insert a value into the storage, we **push** it. When we want to extract a value from the stack, we **pop** it. Every time we **push** values, we stack them in adjacent memory locations, and when we **pop** a value, the top element of the stack is removed.

In this category, we will learn how to implement stack-operation macros that help simplify the code by using the so-called **Stack Memory** to access values that we stored previously for later use. We will implement stack operations, jump operations, functions, and conditionals between two values. Having these will reduce the amount of code we would normally need using just Assembly.

## Solutions Description
Solving the levels is all about implementing stack operation macros using Assembly code and then using these macros for future levels. This way, we will have a list of macros we can use anytime they are needed.

## Solutions Catalogue
Stack Machine levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Stack Operations](Stack-operations/stack_operations.md)
2. [Jumps](Jumps/jumps.md)
3. [Function Calls](Function-calls/function_calls.md)
4. [Conditionals](Conditionals/conditionals.md)
