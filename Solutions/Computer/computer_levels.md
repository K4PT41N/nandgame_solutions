# Computer levels
## Introduction
In this category you learn about CPU and Memory and how are they built using Logic Analog Gates and more logic abstractions built with these Logic Gates.

## Solutions description
I have provided optimal solutions for all levels. My strategy was to solve them using the components I had available from the tool box and replace them with sub parts in order to find connections between Nand Gates that were not needed. I also had to sometimes guess because the optimal solution wasn't straight forward. 

## Solutions catalogue
Computer levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Logic Gates](Logic-Gates/logic_gates.md)
2. [Arithmetics](Arithmetics/arithmetics.md)
3. [Switching](Switching/switching.md)
4. [Arithmetic Logic Unit](Arithmetic-Logic-Unit/arithmetic_logic_unit.md)
5. [Memory](Memory/memory.md)
6. [Processor](Processor/processor.md)
