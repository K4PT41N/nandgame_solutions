# Computer Levels
## Introduction
In this category, we learn about the CPU and memory, and how they are built using logic gates and more complex logic abstractions constructed from these gates.


## Solutions Description
I have provided optimal solutions for all levels. My strategy was to solve them using the components I had available from the toolbox and replace them with subparts in order to find connections between **Nand** gates that were not needed. I also sometimes had to guess, because the optimal solution wasn't straightforward.


## Solutions Catalogue
Computer levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Logic Gates](Logic-Gates/logic_gates.md)
2. [Arithmetics](Arithmetics/arithmetics.md)
3. [Switching](Switching/switching.md)
4. [Arithmetic Logic Unit](Arithmetic-Logic-Unit/arithmetic_logic_unit.md)
5. [Memory](Memory/memory.md)
6. [Processor](Processor/processor.md)
