# Machine Code
In this level, we learn about using machine code to execute instructions by switching bits. These bit flags are grouped for setting operations, storage locations, and conditional jumps. The most significant bit, when 0, basically just sets the register **A** to whichever value the 16-bit instruction is, since it's a data instruction. Bits 0-2 are for conditional jumps, and bits 3-5 are for setting register destinations. Bits 6-10 set the [operations](../Computer/Arithmetic-Logic-Unit/arithmetic_logic_unit.md#alu) programmed for execution. By default, the operations are applied on **D** and **A** registers; otherwise, when the 4th bit is 1, they are applied on **D** and ***A** (value at address stored in **A**) registers. When bit **u** is 0, the operations on the **Logic Unit** are executed; otherwise, the operations on the **Arithmetic Unit** are executed. Understanding how these bit flags work will lead us to solving this level.
