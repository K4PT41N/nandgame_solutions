# Assembler levels
In this category you learn about machine code and Assembly code.

## Solutions description
You get to solve some machine code levels by setting the bits of instructions which are then executed by the CPU where you get the result in the specified registers. Only one level is about writing Assembly code using syntax and symbols. For these types of levels where you write Assembly code, you get to use an Assembler Helper, in order to understand what to use for solving them.

## Solutions catalogue
Assembler levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Machine code](./machine_code.md)
2. [Assembly language](./assembly_language.md)
3. [Assembler program](./assembler_program.md)
