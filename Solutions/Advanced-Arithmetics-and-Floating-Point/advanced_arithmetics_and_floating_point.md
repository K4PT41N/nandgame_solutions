# Advanced Arithmetics and Floating Point levels
## Introduction
In this category we learn about Integer and Floating-Point Arithmetics using Logical Gates and other components we've implemented in other categories. 

## Solutions description
For these levels the solutions are not officially optimal, but they work. Some of them might look messy, but I've tried to make them as clean as I could. We will get to use components from the Toolbox that we will then connect to get the final solution.

## Solutions catalogue
Advanced Arithmetics and Floating Point levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Integer Arithmetics](Integer-Arithmetics/integer_arithmetics.md)
2. [Floating-Point Arithmetics](Floating-Point-Arithmetics/floating_point_arithmetics.md)
