# Advanced Arithmetics and Floating Point Levels
## Introduction
In this category, we learn about integer and floating-point arithmetics using logic gates and other components we've implemented in other categories.

## Solutions Description
For these levels, the solutions are not officially optimal, but they work. Some of them might look messy, but I've tried to make them as clean as possible. We will use components from the toolbox, which we will then connect to get the final solution.

## Solutions Catalogue
Advanced Arithmetics and Floating Point levels are divided into the following subcategories:
1. [Integer Arithmetics](Integer-Arithmetics/integer_arithmetics.md)
2. [Floating-Point Arithmetics](Floating-Point-Arithmetics/floating_point_arithmetics.md)
